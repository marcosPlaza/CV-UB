# CV-UB
Computer Vision projects, University of Barcelona. Here you can find some of my works on different subjects related with Computer Vision, such as:

  1) Introduction. Notebooks to get used to the python modules we're going to use; numpy and skimage.
  2) Basics on Image Processing and Manipulation.
  3) Filtering and edge detection techniques.
  4) Image and video segmentation.
  5) Descriptors extraction for object detection, based on template matching, ORB, and HOG.
  6) Image search using textures.
  7) Haar-like features applied for face detection.
  8) Finally I decided to include a project about Autonomous driving.
